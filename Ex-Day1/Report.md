# Report on Practice 1
## by Serafina Di Gioia

In this directory are contained the codes solving the exercises described in Practice1.pdf, first exercise sheet of the Unsupervised Learning course
by Alex Rodriguez.

The routines for the first, second, third exercises are, respectively:
- LCC-ranking.py
- MIC.py
- PCA.py

Each code contains also the routine developed to estimate the requested distance between the data points in the 
treated dataset.

These codes have been runned with a Python version 3.7.2, and need scipy, pandas and scikit-learn to work.

The outputs generated by the first two codes are in the subdir outputs.


The plots generated with the code 'PCA.py', which develops an algorithm for Principal Component Analysis, are in sub-directory plots.
