In this directory are contained the codes solving the exercise for Practice1 of the Unsupervised Learning course
by Alex Rodriguez.
The routines for the first, second, third exercises are, respectively:
- LCC-ranking.py
- MIC.py
- PCA.py

Each code contains also the routine developed to estimate the requeste distance between the data points in the 
treated dataset.

These codes have been runned with a Python version 3.7.2, and need scipy, pandas and scikit-learn to work.

The outputs generated by the first two codes are in the subdir outputs.


The plots generated with the code 'PCA.py' are in sub-directory plots.
